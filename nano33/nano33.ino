/*
 * This code is supposed to run on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense.
 * It makes full use of all sensors on that device.
 * 
 * It reads atmospheric parameters such as:
 * - temperature
 * - pressure
 * - humidity
 * 
 * It reads other environmental parameters such as light intensity.
 * 
 * It reads ambient sound via the onboard microphone. It performs FFT
 * (Fast Fourier Transform) on the sound samples. From the spectrum generated by FFT
 * some frequencies are discarded (those that appear to be outliers).
 * The rest are transformed via a logarithmic function that mimics the human ear
 * and then are summmed up. The sum is taken to be a measure of ambient noise.
 * 
 * Finally, accelerometer and gyroscope data are recorded, along with magnetic field data.
 * 
 * All these measurements are taken several times per second. Individual samples are
 * averaged over one second, then are sent via USB/serial out.
 * 
 * That's all this code does. Take all measurements from all sensors
 * as fast as possible, and send those out (one line = one batch of measurements).
 * 
 * It's up to the receiver side to parse, interpret, and store that data.
 * 
 * Care was taken to prevent system freeze
 * by allowing brief pauses between sensor reads.
 * 
 * Probably not all sensor reads need to be braketed by delay().
 * But it's time-consuming to figure out which need delay().
 * It's probably easier to intersperse delay() among all sensor reads
 * and just tweak the value of the delay() parameter.
 * A minimmum of one week of uninterrupted work is considered the gold standard
 * for stability.
 * 
 * TBD: In the future some kind of watchdog needs to be implemented
 * since not all lock-up situations can be avoided with code shims such as delay().
 * 
 * A very solid code that doesn't seem to need a watchdog would be
 * a solid base for everything else. A watchdog would then be more like insurance.
